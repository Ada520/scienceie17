T1	Task 39 130	describe the experimental data of the HERMES Collaboration for hadron attenuation on nuclei
T2	Process 131 212	without invoking any changes in the fragmentation function due to gluon radiation
T3	Process 271 274	FSI
T4	Process 276 424	we employ only the ‘free’ fragmentation function on a nucleon and attribute the hadron attenuation to the deceleration of the produced (pre-)hadrons
T5	Process 490 513	the z-dependence of RMh
T6	Task 606 621	determine σlead
T7	Task 1025 1080	the spectra for different particle species (π±,K±,p,p̄)
T8	Task 1096 1141	the formation times of mesons and antibaryons
T9	Task 623 690	The interaction of the leading prehadrons during the formation time
T10	Task 1179 1282	improve our model to describe the primary photon–nucleon reaction below the PYTHIA threshold of W⩾4 GeV
