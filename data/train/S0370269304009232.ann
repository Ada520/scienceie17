T1	Task 12 186	finite-time, future (sudden or Big Rip type) singularities which may occur even when strong energy condition is not violated but equation of state parameter is time-dependent
T2	Task 308 366	back reaction of conformal quantum fields near singularity
T3	Process 396 454	quantum effects may delay (or make milder) the singularity
T4	Task 481 518	evolution to singularity is realistic
T5	Process 543 585	the universe may end up in de Sitter phase
