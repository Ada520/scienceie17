T1	Task 45 66	deformation structure
T2	Process 139 212	action should reduce to N=1/2 super-Yang–Mills theory with adjoint matter
T3	Task 246 265	singlet deformation
T4	Process 281 376	the deformation parameters belongs to the singlet representation of the R-symmetry group SU(2)R
T5	Task 408 496	N=2 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory in the harmonic superspace with singlet deformation
T6	Task 512 555	the gauge and supersymmetry transformations
T7	Process 556 606	get correction linear in the deformation parameter
T8	Process 632 746	perform the field redefinition such that the component fields transform canonically under the gauge transformation
T9	Task 763 792	N=1/2 super-Yang–Mills theory
T10	Process 794 834	such field redefinition is also possible
T11	Task 861 877	component fields
T12	Process 878 954	do not transform canonically under the deformed supersymmtery transformation
T13	Task 963 975	singlet case
T14	Process 995 1115	there is a field redefinition such that the redefined fields also transform canonically under the deformed supersymmetry
T15	Process 1117 1230	We will construct a deformed Lagrangian which is invariant under both the gauge and supersymmetry transformations
T16	Process 1232 1341	We find that the deformed Lagrangian is characterized by a single function of an antiholomorphic scalar field
